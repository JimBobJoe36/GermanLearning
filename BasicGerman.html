        We will review basic German here, like in Section One of Duolingo. We will have these in the Duolingo units (as of December 2024). 
        If Duolingo changes, I might change it, but it will be a while before I get everything on it.

    <h3>Duolingo's note</h3>
    <p>
        Duolingo only gives some common phrases and one note. However, this note is the ONLY thing that matters now (other than spelling).
        This note is as follows:
        <br>
        <b>"In German, you capitalize all nouns!"</b>
        <br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Extra notes</h3>
    <p>
        <br>
        This is important, as it will carry to all writing.
        This is different from the English that you speak, undoubtedly.
        <br>
        <br>
        An example of this would be: 
        <br>
        I went to the Restaurant and ate some Salad.
        <br>
        As you can see, the nouns (restaurant and salad) are capitalized. In this lesson, however, you learn how to say "beer", "tea", "water" and "coffee".
        All of these will be capitalized.

    <h3>Duolingo's Note</h3>
    <p>
        This is actually a helpful item from Duolingo:
        <br>
        "German nouns have gender!"
        <br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Extra things</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        This is very important, but it doesn't help you with anything too major, since it only uses "my" and "a". In English we have "boy things" and "girl things".
        <b>DO NOT ASSUME THAT THIS APPLIES!!!</b>
        <br>
        In this, you are taught "ein", "eine", "mein", and "meine". You add an "e" to the words "a" or "my" if the object is feminine. You will learn more about
        this later.

    <h3>Duolingo's Notes</h3>
    <p>
        Summarized, since they did very well on this:
        <br>
        Not just "a" and "my" changed based on gender, other words, like "the" also change!
        <br>
        <br>
        This is a key idea that carries over, that descripive words, change based on gender.
