    <p>
        We will review basic German here, like in Section One of Duolingo. We will have these in the Duolingo units (as of December 2024). 
        If Duolingo changes, I might change it, but it will be a while before I get everything on it.

    <h3>Duolingo's note</h3>
    <p>
        Duolingo only gives some common phrases and one note. However, this note is the ONLY thing that matters now (other than spelling).
        This note is as follows:
        <br>
        <b>"In German, you capitalize all nouns!"</b>
        <br>
        This is important, as it will carry to all writing.
