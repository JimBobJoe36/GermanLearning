        Welcome to the website! This was made to help learn German, to help you understand the rules. This is to be paired with Duolingo.
        <br>
        <br>
        While doing your Duolingo lessons, you might have noticed that the notes/lessons didn't help AT ALL when
        learning syntax. It frustrated me, and this is to help you get better!
        <br>
        Howver, I am aware that you start of with learning the words, and not the actual syntax, so please keep that in mind.
