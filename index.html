        Welcome to the website! This was made to help learn German, to help you understand the rules. This is to be paired with Duolingo.
        <br>
        <br>
        While doing your Duolingo lessons, you might have noticed that the notes/lessons didn't help AT ALL when
        learning syntax. It frustrated me, and this is to help you get better!
        <br>
        However, I am aware that you start of with learning the words, and not the actual syntax, so please keep that in mind. 
        We, for this website, will use English to structure sentences, and I will link a dictionary in German.
        <br>
        When starting the course, follow through with Duolingo, then once you get to around <b>Section 2</b>, then you should start implementing these.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following buttons will take you to webpages that explain syntax, starting with the basics, then getting more advanced.
